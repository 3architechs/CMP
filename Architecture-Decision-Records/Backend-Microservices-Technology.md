# Java with Spring Boot for the backend API development
## Context:
The system requires a robust and scalable architecture, and the decision has been made to use Java with Spring Boot for the backend API development.
## Decision:
The chosen architecture for the Customer Management Platform System includes Java as the programming language and Spring Boot as the framework for developing the backend API.
## Status:
Accepted
## Rationale:
### 1. Scalability:
#### Pro: Java, known for its scalability, will enable the system to handle a large number of concurrent users and scale seamlessly as the customer base grows.
#### Con: Initial development may take slightly longer due to the statically typed nature of Java, but the long-term benefits in terms of performance and scalability justify this decision.
### 2. Community Support:
#### Pro: Java and Spring Boot have extensive community support, which ensures that the development team can find solutions to problems quickly and benefit from a wealth of resources.
#### Con: Depending on the specific requirements, some niche features might have less community support compared to other languages or frameworks.
### 3. Development Speed:
#### Pro: Spring Boot's convention-over-configuration approach speeds up development, allowing developers to focus on business logic rather than boilerplate code.
#### Con: There might be a learning curve for developers who are not familiar with Java or Spring Boot, but the abundance of tutorials ,documentation and recent advent of AI assisted coding can mitigate this.
### 4. Integration Capabilities:
#### Pro: Java and Spring Boot provide excellent support for integration(tried and tested) with various databases, messaging systems, and other third- party services, ensuring seamless connectivity with other enterprise systems.
#### Con: Ensuring proper integration might require additional effort in terms of configuration and testing.
### 5. Security:
#### Pro: Java has a strong focus on security, and Spring Boot provides features such as built-in support for HTTPS, libraries for secure communication, cryptographic APIs which contributes to a secure backend API.
#### Con: Developers must stay vigilant about potential security vulnerabilities and keep dependencies up-to-date to benefit from the latest security patches.
### Options Considered:
1. Other Programming Languages (e.g., Python, Node.js): Considered but not chosen due to specific requirements related to scalability, performance, and lack of possible expertise issue within the development team.
