# Application will not need a dedicated mobile app
## Context
The Customer Management Platform System is designed to provide users with a comprehensive toolset for managing customer interactions, tracking leads, and facilitating communication. The primary user interface for the system will be delivered through web browsers. The decision to focus on web- based delivery has been made based on considerations related to user experience, development efficiency, and the absence of specific use cases requiring a dedicated mobile app.
## Status:
Accepted
## Decision
Given the considerations outlined below, the decision is to proceed with the development of the Customer Management Platform System as a responsive web application, ensuring accessibility and usability on web browsers, including tablets. No dedicated mobile application will be developed at this time.
## Considerations
### 1. User Experience:
A responsive web application ensures a consistent user experience across various devices, including desktops, laptops, and tablets. 
### 2. Development Efficiency:
Developing and maintaining a single codebase for a responsive web application is more efficient than managing separate codebases for
web and mobile applications. 
### 3. Target User Base:
The primary user base is expected to access the system from desktops and tablets. The absence of a dedicated mobile app aligns with
the usage patterns and preferences of the target audience. 
### 4. Cost Considerations:
Focusing on web-based development allows for cost-effective and streamlined development without the additional overhead of building
and maintaining a separate mobile application. 
### 5. Technological Considerations:
Modern web technologies and frameworks support responsive design, enabling the application to adapt to various screen sizes effectively.
## Rationale:
### 1. Consistent User Experience:
Users accessing the system through web browsers on different devices will experience a consistent and responsive interface. 
### 2. Development Streamlining:
Development efforts will be focused on a single codebase, simplifying maintenance and updates. 
### 3. Reduced Development Costs:
The decision avoids the additional costs associated with developing and maintaining a dedicated mobile application.
## Implications
### 1. Implementation Guidelines:
Develop and communicate guidelines for implementing responsive design principles throughout the development process. 
### 2. Continuous Monitoring:
Establish a system for continuous monitoring of user analytics and feedback to assess the need for adjustments or future enhancements, including potential mobile app development.
