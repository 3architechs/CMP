# React.js as the framework for building the user interface
## Context
We are tasked with designing and implementing a Customer Management Platform (CMP) system. The system is expected to have a modern, responsive, and user-friendly front end. After evaluating various options, it has been decided to use React.js as the framework for building the user interface.
## Status:
Accepted
## Decision
We have decided to build the front end of the CMP system using React.js.
## Rationale:
1. Component-Based Architecture: React follows a component-based architecture, which allows us to break down the UI into reusable components. This modularity makes it easier to manage and maintain the codebase, especially as the CMP system may evolve over time with new features.
2. Virtual DOM for Efficient Rendering: React utilizes a virtual DOM, which improves rendering performance by minimizing actual DOM manipulations. This is crucial for a responsive user interface, especially in a CMP system where users interact with various data and views.
3. Rich Ecosystem and Community Support: React has a large and active community, providing a wealth of libraries, tools, and resources. This ecosystem facilitates faster development, easy integration with other technologies, and the availability of best practices.
4. Single Page Application (SPA) Support: React is well-suited for building Single Page Applications, where the user interacts with the application without the need for full page reloads. SPAs provide a smoother user experience, which is essential for a CMP system where users often navigate between different sections and data.
## Implications
While the decision to use React brings numerous benefits, there are some considerations and consequences:
### 1. Browser Compatibility: 
Although React is designed to work across different browsers, testing and ensuring compatibility with older browsers may be necessary.
### 2. Dependency Management: 
Regular updates to React and its ecosystem may require ongoing maintenance to keep the application up-to-date with the latest features and security patches.
